      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=3>CATHEDRAL takes moments to learn, 
      years to master. The rules are few which is one of it's main attractions 
      but as you will discover the possibilities are endless.<BR><BR><STRONG><A 
      name=Introduction>INTRODUCTION</A></STRONG><BR>CATHEDRAL is based on the 
      concept of a City surrounded by a wall. The board, divided into one 
      hundred squares (10x10) represents the site of the city enclosed by the 
      wall. The two sets of pieces, light (bright) and dark (brown) symbolize 
      the buildings and the two opposing factions struggling to gain power and 
      hence dictate the way the city will develop.<BR><BR>Then there is the 
      CATHEDRAL the focal point of the city, a spiritual haven a place of 
      sanctuary which mediates in the struggle and helps prevent one side from 
      becoming too powerful and thus allows the city to develop in an orderly 
      manner. But beware! There is still much to learn about cities and the 
      forces which shaped them. Who knows what secrets lie hidden in this simple 
      game waiting to be discovered.<BR><STRONG><BR><A 
      name="RULES OF PLAY">RULES OF PLAY</A></STRONG><BR>Start by removing all 
      the pieces from the board and splitting them into two camps, Dark and 
      Light. The players decide which colour they will have (no arguing 
      allowed).<BR><BR>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of the game is to place 
      all your buildings within the walls of the city, while trying to prevent 
      your opponent from doing so.<BR><BR>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A move consists 
      of placing a building anywhere in the city so that it is lined up with the 
      squares.<BR><BR>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are playing with the bright 
      buildings you commence the game by placing the Cathedral anywhere within 
      the city. Your opponent playing with the brown pieces makes the first and 
      each alternate move. The players then take turns placing the Cathedral at 
      the beginning of each game.<BR><BR>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you completely 
      enclose a part of the city with your buildings alone or with your 
      buildings and the wall, this part of the city becomes your property and 
      your opponent may not place any of his buildings within it. The buildings 
      must meet wall to wall, a corner to corner contact is not acceptable. Your 
      opponent may claim space in the same way. You may not use the Cathedral as 
      part of the boundary to enclose the claimed space. Neither you nor your 
      opponent may claim space on your first move. (See notes 1, 2 &amp; 
      6)<BR><BR>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you enclose and therefore isolate one 
      and only one of your opponent's buildings or the Cathedral you may remove 
      it and claim the space enclosed. The building must be removed immediately 
      after the move during which it was enclosed otherwise it must remain where 
      it is and the space is still available to your opponent. Your opponent's 
      building may be replayed in a later move but the Cathedral once removed is 
      not replaced for the remainder of that game. If you enclose two or more 
      buildings. one of which may be the Cathedral, then none of the buildings 
      may be removed and the space is still available to your opponent (See 
      notes 3,4 &amp;5)<BR><BR>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game ends when no 
      further moves can be made by either player.<BR><BR>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The winner is the player who succeeds in placing all his buildings within 
      the city while preventing his opponent from doing so. If neither player 
      succeeds in doing this then the player whose unplaced buildings would 
      occupy the least number of squares is the winner otherwise the result is a 
      draw.<BR><BR>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a series of games is played, the 
      players alternate placing the Cathedral and making the first move. At the 
      end of each game players are awarded points equal to the number of squares 
      their unplaced buildings would cover. The winner of the series is the 
      player with the smallest total of points.</FONT></P>

      the early stages of the game.<BR>B / Play your largest buildings
